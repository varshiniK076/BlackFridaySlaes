The Black Friday sales project utilizes the XGBoost algorithm, a powerful gradient boosting technique, to predict customer purchase behavior based on various features such as demographics, past purchase history, and product preferences. By training on historical data, XGBoost learns intricate patterns and relationships, enabling accurate predictions of sales volumes and identifying key factors driving purchases during the Black Friday event. Leveraging XGBoost's capabilities, the project aims to optimize marketing strategies, enhance customer targeting, and maximize revenue generation for retailers during this high-stakes shopping event.
